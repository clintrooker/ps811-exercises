  abstract = {The concept of non-domination is an important contribution to the study of freedom but it does not comprehend the whole of freedom. Insofar as domination requires a conscious capacity for control on the part of the dominant party, it fails to capture important threats to individual freedom that permeate many contemporary liberal democracies today. Much of the racism, sexism and other cultural biases that currently constrain the life-chances of members of subordinate groups in the USA are largely unconscious and unintentional, and they do not always involve control. Although they constitute real barriers to freedom, these forms of influence are not accurately characterized as domination, and they will require different mechanisms to overcome them. To achieve the more capacious freedoms that liberal democracy promises, we will need to go beyond non-domination and to come to terms with the non-sovereign, socially distributed character of human agency.},

  abstract = {The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion synthesizes leading studies of public opinion from the late 1980s in a top-down model of opinion formation and change. The core feature of this synthesis, the Receive-AcceptSample (RAS) model, remains sound, but the book overstates the importance of the form of public opinion that it explains*elite-induced survey statements of issue positions*and understates the force of opinions that elites cannot easily shape and that citizens may not be able to articulate in response to survey prompts. Moreover, there are major problems in the book's Parable of Purple Land. What, then, becomes of the top-down view of elite-mass interaction outlined in Nature and Origins? To answer this question, I begin by characterizing the kinds of opinions Nature and Origins leaves out: Converse's ``group interest'' voters, ``nature of the times'' voters, and issue publics. I then add a model of political parties as policy-motivated organizers of Converse's voter types. The upshot is an account of elite/mass interactions that is still largely top-down and that has roles for both the elite-led attitudes that the RAS model explains and the less conventional and harder-to-shape attitudes that it overlooks.},

  abstract = {The classic Handbook of Social Psychology has been the standard professional reference for the field of social psychology for the past 50 years. Now available in a new edition, this internationally acclaimed resource maintains the high standards of previous editions by recruiting leading experts from all areas of social psychology to bring readers up to date on new scientific methods and analytic techniques and to take stock of research advances in their respective specialties. In addition to a new and diverse group of authors, this edition is filled with new topics, such as emotions, self, automaticity, stigma, memory, and evolution, among others. The editors, who are three of social psychology's most noted researchers, have structured the volume to highlight the many levels of analysis used by contemporary psychologists, while maintaining a focus on social psychology's core concern: how do people think about, feel, and act toward one another? Social Psychology's central questions have changed throughout the past 50 years, and the scientific approaches to them have changed even more. This expanded focus has led to many exciting developments that are detailed in this new edition. All academics, graduate students, and professional social psychologists will want to own a copy of this essential resource.},

  abstract = {In this 1992 book John Zaller develops a comprehensive theory to explain how people acquire political information from elites and the mass media and convert it into political preferences. Using numerous specific examples, Zaller applies this theory to the dynamics of public opinion on a broad range of subjects, including domestic and foreign policy, trust in government, racial equality, and presidential approval, as well as voting behaviour in U.S. House, Senate, and presidential elections. The thoery is constructed from four basic premises. The first is that individuals differ substantially in their attention to politics and therefore in their exposure to elite sources of political information. The second is that people react critically to political communication only to the extent that they are knowledgeable about political affairs. The third is that people rarely have fixed attitudes on specific issues; rather, they construct 'preference statements' on the fly as they confront each issue raised. The fourth is that, in constructing these statements, people make the greatest use of ideas that are, for various reasons, the most immediately salient to them. Zaller emphasizes the role of political elites in establishing the terms of political discourse in the mass media and the powerful effect of this framing of issues on the dynamics of mass opinion on any given issue over time.},
